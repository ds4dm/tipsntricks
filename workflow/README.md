# From doing math to writing code

Slides and demo code for the tutorial _From doing math to writing code_.

## `etc/`

Sample code (julia):
* `unit_testing.ipynb`: a short example of unit testing
* `profiling.ipynb`: a short example use of the Julia profiler. Imports source code from `profile_code.jl`.

To run these notebooks, you need Julia v1.0 with the IJulia package installed, and jupyter for running the notebooks. Alternatively, you can view the `.html`files in any web browser (but then you can't play with the code).
