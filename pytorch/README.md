# PyTorch tutorial
## Antoine Prouvost

Put your understanding of deep learning into practice with (one of) the most flexible deep learning framework.

This interactive tutorial will show you how to implement a neural network along with some theoretical reminders, practical tips, and suggested code workflows.
At first, PyTorch seems similar to Numpy, optimized high level numerical operations on arrays. This tutorial will show the three main components that makes PyTorch a dedicated Deep Learning framework, namely:
  - **GPU acceleration**, _i.e._ the ability do run parallel computation on a graphic card;
  - **Automatic differentiation**, _i.e._ an algorithm to automatically compute the gradients at a given point;
  - **A neural network API**, _i.e._ a set of classes and functions defining common deep learning abstractions, such as layers, datasets, and first order optimization algorithms.

PyTorch is both efficient in term of computations, and as little complexity for the user. As an exercise, we will use it to train a convolutional neural network for digit recognition.
