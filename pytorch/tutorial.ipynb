    "[PyTorch](http://www.pytorch.org) is a deep learning framework for modeling and training neural networks, with possible GPU acceleration. It is a very flexible framework with a Python-first interface that is executed dynamically (operations are done when the python instruction is executed) as opposed to other compiled system such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).\n",

    "### Locally\n",
    "You can run this notebook locally using Python >= 3.6, and an installation of PyTorch. You can use PyTorch without GPU (all the functionalities are supported on CPU), however if you want GPU accleleration for you computation, you need an Nvidia GPU, CUDA, and CUDNN. Installation details are not provided in this tutorial.\n",

In practice, being dynamic means that PyTorch will behave like numpy, doing the actual computation when the instruction is exectued. On the contrary, static computation graph use Python to build a description of waht to do, and only perform computation later on. As for numpy, we take advantage of vectorized operations by making them over an `ndarray`. In PyTorch, we call them `Tensor` but they behave similarly."
