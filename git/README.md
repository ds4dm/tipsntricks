# Git/Github tutorial
## Antoine Prouvost

Version control systems (VCS) are tools to store and manage the evolution of a project through time, versions, and contributors.
Git is the almost universal VCS used to manage codebases, from a single user project on a personal computer, to billion dollars software.
Github is a famous git implementation as an online service, useful to collaborate on project and publish code.

If you ever find yourself working on multiple versions/features of a program and lose track of all the changes you are making, git will help you manage your cognitive load. If you broke your code and wish you could get back to a previous version, git will let you restore previous versions. If you cannot run your code because there is work in progress, git will help you maintain a latest working version. If you need to collaborate, search no longer, git is the answer.

In this interactive tutorial, we will learn the mechanisms of git (commits, branches, repositories) and the commands to interact with them (init, status, log, add, rm, mv, commit, fetch, pull, push, branch, merge, rebase). A focus is also put on using Github, visual interfaces, and best practices to get the best out of git.

The tutorial will focus on usability and will provide as much use cases for researchers as possible.
